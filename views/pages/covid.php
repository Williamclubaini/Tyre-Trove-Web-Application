            any other option but to remain in isolation to help not to spread the virus hence Tyre Trove will be able to
            ship their orders on certain condition:<br>
            <span class="fst-italic">A. Your orders are to be received with someone else who is not effected by the
                virus.<br></span>.
            <span class="fw-bold">NOTE: our health team will travel together to make sure and test if the one receiving
                is not effected
                by covid-19.</span>.
